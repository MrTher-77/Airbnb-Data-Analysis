# data-analysis-project
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of Airbnb user profiles and behaviors using product analytics methods, intending to turn raw data into actionable growth insights for the Airbnb product. It focuses on three core modules:

Customer Profile Analysis: Develop a data-driven understanding of user demographics, enabling the identification of high-engagement groups, along with their key characteristics.

Promotion Channel Analysis: Evaluate acquisition sources and affiliate channels by comparing traffic, registrations, and conversion performance, highlighting which channels drive quality users rather than just volume.

Conversion Funnel Analysis: Map the user journey across major product steps (search → reserve → pay), quantify drop-offs at each stage, and surface friction points that explain why users fail to convert or repurchase.

By combining descriptive analytics, segment comparisons, and funnel metrics, the project provides a practical framework for diagnosing growth bottlenecks and prioritizing improvements in acquisition strategy, onboarding, and conversion optimization.

(ps: Visualization diagram of conversion funnel analysis is not supported by online complier so I uploaded it as "funnel.png" for your reference:)
